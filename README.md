# 🌍 Earthquake Prediction using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based predictive modeling system leveraging seismic and geospatial features to forecast earthquake occurrences. The model is developed using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on historical earthquake data to identify patterns and improve prediction reliability.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Architecture:** Fully connected deep neural network
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras (Sequential API)
- **Loss Function:** Depends on target type 
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Loss, or custom metrics as per the task 

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Feature engineering from seismic time-series data
- Train-test validation pipeline using stratified sampling
- Scalable architecture suitable for deployment or integration into larger geospatial analysis systems
- Visual diagnostics including learning curves and model behavior under various configurations
